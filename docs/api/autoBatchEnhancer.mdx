# `autoBatchEnhancer`

A Redux store enhancer that looks for one or more "low-priority" dispatched actions in a row, and queues a callback to run subscriber notifications on a delay. It then notifies subscribers either when the queued callback runs, or when the next "normal-priority" action is dispatched, whichever is first.

## Basic Usage

```ts
import {
  createSlice,
  configureStore,
  autoBatchEnhancer,
  prepareAutoBatched,
} from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

interface CounterState {
  value: number
}

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: { value: 0 } as CounterState,
  reducers: {
    incrementBatched: {
      // Batched, low-priority
      reducer(state) {
        state.value += 1
      },
      // highlight-start
      // Use the `prepareAutoBatched` utility to automatically
      // add the `action.meta[SHOULD_AUTOBATCH]` field the enhancer needs
      prepare: prepareAutoBatched<void>(),
      // highlight-end
    },
    // Not batched, normal priority
    decrementUnbatched(state) {
      state.value -= 1
    },
  },
})
const { incrementBatched, decrementUnbatched } = counterSlice.actions

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: counterSlice.reducer,
  // highlight-start
  enhancers: (existingEnhancers) => {
    // Add the autobatch enhancer to the store setup
    return existingEnhancers.concat(autoBatchEnhancer())
  },
  // highlight-end
})
```

## API

### `autoBatchEnhancer`

```ts title="autoBatchEnhancer signature" no-transpile
export type SHOULD_AUTOBATCH = string
type AutoBatchOptions =
  | { type: 'tick' }
  | { type: 'timer'; timeout: number }
  | { type: 'raf' }
  | { type: 'callback'; queueNotification: (notify: () => void) => void }

export type autoBatchEnhancer = (options?: AutoBatchOptions) => StoreEnhancer
```

Creates a new instance of the autobatch store enhancer.

Any action that is tagged with `action.meta[SHOULD_AUTOBATCH] = true` will be treated as "low-priority", and a notification callback will be queued. The enhancer will delay notifying subscribers until either:

- The queued callback runs and triggers the notifications
- A "normal-priority" action (any action _without_ `action.meta[SHOULD_AUTOBATCH] = true`) is dispatched in the same tick

`autoBatchEnhancer` accepts options to configure how the notification callback is queued:

- `{type: 'raf'}`: queues using `requestAnimationFrame` (default)
- `{type: 'tick'}: queues using `queueMicrotask`
- `{type: 'timer, timeout: number}`: queues using `setTimeout`
- `{type: 'callback', queueNotification: (notify: () => void) => void}: lets you provide your own callback, such as a debounced or throttled function

The default behavior is to queue the notifications using `requestAnimationFrame`.

The `SHOULD_AUTOBATCH` value is meant to be opaque - it's currently a string for simplicity, but could be a `Symbol` in the future.

### `prepareAutoBatched`

```ts title="prepareAutoBatched signature" no-transpile
type prepareAutoBatched = <T>() => (payload: T) => { payload: T; meta: unknown }
```

Creates a function that accepts a `payload` value, and returns an object with `{payload, meta: {[SHOULD_AUTOBATCH]: true}}`. This is meant to be used with RTK's `createSlice` and its "`prepare` callback" syntax:

```ts no-transpile
createSlice({
  name: 'todos',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    todoAdded: {
      reducer(state, action: PayloadAction<Todo>) {
        state.push(action.payload)
      },
      // highlight-start
      prepare: prepareAutoBatched<Todo>(),
      // highlight-end
    },
  },
})
```

## Batching Approach and Background

The post [A Comparison of Redux Batching Techniques](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2020/01/blogged-answers-redux-batching-techniques/) describes four different approaches for "batching Redux actions/dispatches"

- a higher-order reducer that accepts multiple actions nested inside one real action, and iterates over them together
- an enhancer that wraps `dispatch` and debounces the notification callback
- an enhancer that wraps `dispatch` to accept an array of actions
- React's `unstable_batchedUpdates()`, which just combines multiple queued renders into one but doesn't affect subscriber notifications

This enhancer is a variation of the "debounce" approach, but with a twist.

Instead of _just_ debouncing _all_ subscriber notifications, it watches for any actions with a specific `action.meta[SHOULD_AUTOBATCH]: true` field attached.

When it sees an action with that field, it queues a callback. The reducer is updated immediately, but the enhancer does _not_ notify subscribers right way. If other actions with the same field are dispatched in succession, the enhancer will continue to _not_ notify subscribers. Then, when the queued callback runs, it finally notifies all subscribers, similar to how React batches re-renders.

The additional twist is also inspired by React's separation of updates into "low-priority" and "immediate" behavior (such as a render queued by an AJAX request vs a render queued by a user input that should be handled synchronously).

If some low-pri actions have been dispatched and a notification microtask is queued, then a _normal_ priority action (without the field) is dispatched, the enhancer will go ahead and notify all subscribers synchronously as usual, and _not_ notify them at the end of the tick.

This allows Redux users to selectively tag certain actions for effective batching behavior, making this purely opt-in on a per-action basis, while retaining normal notification behavior for all other actions.

### RTK Query and Batching

RTK Query already marks several of its key internal action types as batchable. If you add the `autoBatchEnhancer` to the store setup, it will improve the overall UI performance, especially when rendering large lists of components that use the RTKQ query hooks.
