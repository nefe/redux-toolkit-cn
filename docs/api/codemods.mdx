# Codemods

Per [the description in `1.9.0-alpha.0`](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases/tag/v1.9.0-alpha.0), we plan to remove the "object" argument from `createReducer` and `createSlice.extraReducers` in the future RTK 2.0 major version. In `1.9.0-alpha.0`, we added a one-shot runtime warning to each of those APIs.

To simplify upgrading codebases, we've published a set of codemods that will automatically transform the deprecated "object" syntax into the equivalent "builder" syntax.

The codemods package is available on NPM as [**`@reduxjs/rtk-codemods`**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reduxjs/rtk-codemods). It currently contains two codemods: `createReducerBuilder` and `createSliceBuilder`.

To run the codemods against your codebase, run `npx @reduxjs/rtk-codemods <TRANSFORM NAME> path/of/files/ or/some**/*glob.js`.

Examples:

```bash
npx @reduxjs/rtk-codemods createReducerBuilder ./src

npx @reduxjs/rtk-codemods createSliceBuilder ./packages/my-app/**/*.ts
```

We also recommend re-running Prettier on the codebase before committing the changes.

**These codemods _should_ work, but we would greatly appreciate testing and feedback on more real-world codebases!**

Before:

```js
createReducer(initialState, {
  [todoAdded1a]: (state, action) => {
    // stuff
  },
  [todoAdded1b]: (state, action) => action.payload,
})

const slice1 = createSlice({
  name: 'a',
  initialState: {},
  extraReducers: {
    [todoAdded1a]: (state, action) => {
      // stuff
    },
    [todoAdded1b]: (state, action) => action.payload,
  },
})
```

After:

```js
createReducer(initialState, (builder) => {
  builder.addCase(todoAdded1a, (state, action) => {
    // stuff
  })

  builder.addCase(todoAdded1b, (state, action) => action.payload)
})

const slice1 = createSlice({
  name: 'a',
  initialState: {},

  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder.addCase(todoAdded1a, (state, action) => {
      // stuff
    })

    builder.addCase(todoAdded1b, (state, action) => action.payload)
  },
})
```
